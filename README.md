# Lesson-20-uniqe
The code iterates through each element in the `num_list`. For each `number`, it checks if the number is not already in the `unique` list. If the number is not in `unique`, it appends the number to `unique` and immediately prints the updated `unique` list. The result is that only unique values from `num_list` are added to `unique` and printed step by step as they are added.
